> In November 1995, Chanelle Pickett, an African-American transsexual woman, was strangled to death at age 23. At her service, Chanelle’s twin sister, Gabrielle, also a transsexual woman, remembered her as a vibrant person, “full of life… high-spirited… with many goals.”
> 
> In the year prior to Chanelle’s murder, the two sisters, both working steadily at NYNEX in Brookline, MA, were “outed” as transsexuals, viciously harassed by a supervisor for six weeks, and ultimately fired. Stunned, exhausted, and unable to find work elsewhere, both women fell quickly into desperate poverty. Chanelle, a prime target for a man with a predatory attitude toward transgender women, turned up dead in William Palmer’s apartment. According to the coroner, Chanelle’s body was found with “bruised face and lips,” and her “brain was badly swollen, the neck muscles were bruised, and there was hemorrhaging in the eyes.” Despite strong physical evidence against Palmer, he was convicted only of assault & battery. He received 2 years of jail time, a longer sentence than the prosecutor had requested, with Judge Robert A. Barton acknowledging the particularly “vicious” nature of the killing.
>
> The tragedy of Chanelle Pickett’s murder illustrates some of the connections between violence and pervasive employment discrimination. Chanelle was an ordinary woman working at NYNEX until her transsexuality made her a target for harassment. Although she properly sought help from a supervisor, her predicament was ignored. She transferred to a different department, but harassment against her continued openly and unabated. Eventually, she was fired. Unable to find work and having exhausted her legitimate options, Chanelle finally turned to prostitution for survival, a dangerous last resort. Before her murder, she surely suffered hopelessness for many months, feeding a growing desperation that led her to take risks that would never have been necessary had she not lost her job.
> 
> Chanelle Pickett’s killer did not just target a transsexual woman; he preyed on a woman who had already been victimized because of her identity. Chanelle lost her livelihood because of transphobia, and her opportunities to rebuild her life were nearly non-existent because of pervasive discrimination. Unprotected by laws against discrimination, her vibrant life was brutally cut short because so many doors had already been closed to her.
