Both had sought asylum in the USA a year earlier seeking refuge from the violence and transphobia in El Salvador.

> Asociación Aspidh Arcoiris Trans, a Salvadoran trans advocacy group, told the Washington Blade that Aurora, who was also known as Camila, had been reported missing at the end of January.
> 
> The group looked for Camila at various hospitals and eventually learned she had been admitted to Rosales National Hospital in San Salvador, the Salvadoran capital, on Jan. 31 with multiple injuries. Camila passed away on Feb. 3.
> 
> She did not deserve to be killed in this way. We knew her. She was a great human being. A humble woman. the pain and the impotence of knowing what happened to her life and that they did not listen to her and that they did not believe her. All she wanted was to live hopefully that her life would change as she hoped.
> 
> Like many more of the LGBTTTI community they were killed. They are killing us. This must stop their homophobia,  transphobia and lesfobia. Jardin De Las Mariposas feels the pain of knowing that a sister was killed we will remember you when you arrived the first time and when you left you rest in peace at Aurora.

LGBT+ organisation Agencia Presentes originally reported her murder:

> LGBTI organization, Presentes, reported police in the capital San Salvador assaulted the first victim. Presentes is still investigating what led to the murder of Camila a 29-year-old sex worker.
> 
> Camila did not return to her house on 30 January and Presentes is working on two hypothesis of what happened.
> 
> One of the hypothesis is that Camila’s fellow sex workers attacked her. But a number of those sex workers told Presentes that they saw police attack Camila and dump her body several kilometers away from where she worked.
> 
> ‘Presentes has asked police for an official response but it has closed the case and has not responded,’ the organization said in a statement.
> 
> Camila’s body was found on Thursday 31 January and was taken to a nearby hospital where she died from her injuries three days later.

In July 2019 three police officers were arrested on suspicion of having participated in deprivation of liberty and aggravated homicide.

She was a reality TV star who had appeared in Big Brother Australia and the UK TV show ""There’s Something About Miriam"".

> Shocking new details have surfaced about the mysterious death of transgender reality star Miriam Rivera. Miriam, who appeared on Big Brother Australia in 2004 and British dating show There’s Something About Miriam, died aged 38 in Hermosillo, Mexico on February 5.
>
> Her death wasn’t reported until this week, and Daily Mail Australia can now reveal that family members were threatened if they tried to investigate what happened.
>
> In an exclusive interview from his home in New York, Miriam’s husband Daniel Cuervo said that he suspects she met with a violent end. 
>
> Mr Cuervo claimed an unknown male had called him when he was trying to arrange Miriam’s funeral and said: ‘Don’t come back to Mexico or we’ll kill you too.’. He later found out her body had already been cremated, leaving no opportunity to perform an autopsy, which he found ‘very suspicious’.
>
> Because he feared for his safety, Mr Cuervo wasn’t able to arrange a proper funeral for his wife. Photos have since surfaced on Facebook of a decidedly low-key memorial service.
>
> Mr Cuervo believes his wife’s death may have been ‘passed off’ as a suicide after she refused to accept work as a prostitute for a man who was ‘infatuated’ with her. He recalled the day Miriam died: ‘On the morning of February 5, Miriam called me [in New York] from Mexico, telling me she was feeling sick and vomiting blood, so I told her to go to the hospital.
>
> ‘She called me again before leaving the hospital at 12pm and that was the last time we spoke.’
>
> At 2pm, Miriam was found dead by hanging at her home in Hermosillo.

Her mutilated body was found inside the sanctum of the Mariamman temple which she had been running. She had been beheaded and her head left outside the temple premises by 2 men who lived in the vicinity. 

The assailants are on the run.

> The main accused is identified as 23-year-old Maruthu, who owns the land on which Rajathi's temple is built. According to the police, Maruthu, along with his aide, is said to have visited the temple with a sickle when Rajathi was performing a pooja inside the sanctum on Friday morning
> 
> Maruthu and his aide then attacked her, chopped her body and placed her head outside the temple, Grace Banu, the founder of Trans Rights Now Collective and a native of Thoothukudi, told TNM. According to sources from the trans community, the accused had been harassing Rajathi for the past year.
> 
> “We heard that he used to threaten her and shout at her as the land belonged to his grandmother. She had been getting calls from him for the past one year,” Grace says.
> 
> ""Maruthi and his brothers own the land where this temple is located. After the falling out, it was just Rajathi who was taking care of the temple affairs. A few days ago, Maruthu learnt that she had entered into a relationship with another man. It was following this that the bloodshed took place. Besides this, the 5 brothers also used to harass Rajathi and the trans women who came to the temple to pray. When she took over the temple, we feel they feared that the temple would fall into the hands of the trans community,"" the source from the community, who did not want to be named, told TNM.

"Faye (""Morena Black"")",,2019_02_24_Faye-Morena-Black.jpg,https://twitter.com/PansexualJohnny/status/1100760118709366789,24-Feb-2019,,,Florida,USA,29.065599,-81.884201,suicide,"Faye reportedly took her own life sometime during the weekend of 23rd/24th February.

Every loss to suicide is an absolute tragedy, and that of Faye is certainly no different. As someone who worked in the adult movie industry her personality and life has probably been subjected to far more scrutiny than most of us, and inevitably for many the person who they remember will be the media personna rather than the real person.

In Faye's case, we can only do what we can to try to balance that out - to give others a chance to remember Faye, the loving wife of Terri, rather than Morena Black, Faye's stage personna.

Faye's wife Terri was kind enough to share the following quote about her:

> ""She knitted and sewed. She liked cooking Puerto Rican food to expand my horizon. We live on a dirt road in a redneck area. EVERYBODY loved us. Except our nearest neighbors, they're religious types but they never bothered us. She said Meow a lot.
> 
> ""She did not like the Leftist mindset of our community and watched me get blocked and banned for not having the good sense to shut up on politics. She supported Trump and absolutely despised Kamala Harris. She filled our home with Dixie and Gadsen flags. A dixie flag is NOT racist.
> 
> ""Her Twitter persona, nor her in person persona towards industry participants, was 180 degrees from the real Faye. She closed her social media,too fake, and finally quit smoking weed. She had just applied for a job at Dollar general because the manager there loved us.""

Thais,25,,,26-Feb-2019,,Carapicuíba,São Paulo,Brazil,-23.5261668,-46.8198264,stabbed,"Thais and her (cisgender) boyfriend were found stabbed to death in a public toilet in Paturis Park. Both were homeless drug users.

> The trans woman was sitting on a mattress, leaning against one of the walls of the bathroom, which measures approximately 1.8 x 3.0 meters, and barefoot. Together with the bodies, a blanket, a backpack and a flashlight were also found on the floor.
> 
> The crime scene was considered ""shocking"" by those who had access to the scene. The amount of blood and the violence of the injuries can be indicative that more than one person could have committed the murders.
> 
> Although there is no evidence of homophobic crime, the death of a trans woman in Paturis Park refers to a story that happened more than ten years ago. Between July 2007 and August 2008, 13 homosexuals were killed on the spot. Most of the bodies were found face down, with shots at the nape of the neck, half-naked and with pants down - which is a crime of sexual intolerance.
