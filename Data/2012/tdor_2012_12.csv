She died in hospital. An hour later, the police arrested Víctor York Rojas López, 28, in the Versailles neighborhood.

> There are two hypotheses about motives. Some say her killer ws a client who offered her $5,000 for sex. Yeisi would have accepted and gone with the subject to the Central Cemetery of Magangué (which is used as a motel by several local sex workers, either because of lack of money to enter a motel or because they are denied entry, according to Wilson Castañeda, director of the Caribe Afirmative organization, which defends the rights of the LGBT population). Then there would have been an argument between Yeisi and her client, in which the latter ended up stabbing the trans woman.
> 
> Another version indicates that Yeisi was the receipient of a death threat from someone who had an altercation with some time ago. Supposedly, the subject offered money to a nephew to kill her, and the latter would have posed as a client to take Yeisi to a solitary place and kill her.

Civil liberties organizations alleged that the victim died after she was tortured by the police and have demanded a judicial inquiry. Police authorities made wild allegations against the deceased in a bid to discredit him and hush up the case. They argued that the victim was 'a vagabond after he lost his parents when he was a teenager and had even become a eunuch.' Newspapers reported, that this takes the total count of custodial deaths in the police station to four in the last two years.
