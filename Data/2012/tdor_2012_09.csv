She was a counsellor at the Gay and Lesbian Latino AIDS Education Initiative.

> The transgender woman found murdered earlier this month in Frankford has been identified as a former staff member at a local LGBT agency.
>
> Police found the body of Kyra Cordova Sept. 3 in a wooded area off of Adams Avenue. Cordova, 27, who went by the name Kyra Kruz on social media, is a former volunteer and employee of the Gay and Lesbian Latino AIDS Education Initiative.
>
> Cordova’s body was found shortly after 5 a.m. on Labor Day with a gunshot wound to the head. Investigators say Cordova was last seen at a nearby Wawa, where she purchased two sandwiches and two drinks.
>
> According to her Facebook profile, Cordova graduated from North Penn Senior High School in Lansdale in 2003. Her MySpace page says she was in college studying biology, with aspirations of opening her own transgender medical facility.
>
> Elicia Gonzales, executive director of GALAEI, said Cordova began volunteering with the agency in 2010 and was hired as an HIV tester within a few months. “She came in one day out of the blue just full of energy and life, saying she wanted to volunteer,” Gonzales said. “As soon as a position became open, she was first in line to apply.”
>
> While Cordova was technically a part-time employee, she often put in full-time hours. On her first day on the job as a volunteer, she, without being asked, put together a PowerPoint presentation about GALAEI’s services for display in the agency’s lobby.
>
> Last summer, Cordova coordinated and performed in GALAEI’s carnival-themed Pride parade contingent.
>
> “The impact she made on not just our staff but on the whole community GALAEI serves was immeasurable,” Gonzales said. “Her energy and enthusiasm carried over into everything, in her work as a counselor and just as part of the GALAEI family.”
>
> Gloria Casarez, the city’s director of LGBT affairs, called Cordova a “vibrant, visible face in the community.”
>
> “She was a young person engaged in work that is about all of our lives,” Casarez said. “She was visible, she liked to have fun and even people who didn’t know her are going to relate to her.”

> At the beginning of last year, Damião's defense called for the revocation of his remand, which was denied. In January of this year, he was pronounced by the court for qualified murder, committed treason, by ambush or by means of appeal that made the defense of the victim impossible. The popular jury was scheduled for today at 10am. The penalty, if convicted, ranges from 12 to 30 years in prison.

> A Vancouver support group for the transgender community is mourning the loss of one of their members after she was stabbed to death on Saturday.  
>
> Police identified the victim of New Westminster’s first homicide of the year Thursday as 26-year-old January Marie Lapuz, who legally changed her name from [deadname] in 2008.
>
> The stabbing death happened in the 500-block of 3rd Avenue at about 10 p.m. on Saturday and Lapuz died later in hospital. Police said an Asian man, around 5-5 tall, was seen running from the scene.

January was the first transgender person to hold an executive position with Sher Vancouver, a support group for South Asian gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

> Alex Sangha, Founder of Sher Vancouver, a support group for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender South Asians said the community is shocked and saddened by her death.
>
> “She was very young and really a bright light and shining star,” Sangha said. “Everyone is very sad and very shocked. The way she died was very sad.”
>
> Sangha said Lapuz, who became social coordinator of Sher Vancouver in 2009, faced a lot of challenges as a transgender woman.
>
> “She had a lot of inner turmoil as a woman who was transgender and living in poverty with limited social support as an immigrant,” Sangha said. “We’re already very at risk in the community, a lot of people stigmatize [transgender people] and I just think it’s horrible – it’s a huge loss.”
>
> Despite these challenges, Sangha said she excelled as social coordinator of the group. “She was so natural with people, such great communication skills. She was the host of all our events, did fundraising… she was a great singer, she was a good public speaker,” Sangha said.
