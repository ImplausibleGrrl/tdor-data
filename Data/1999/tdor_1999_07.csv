Pvt. Barry L. Winchell,,,,5-Jul-1999,tdor.info/7-5-1999/Pvt. Barry L. Winchell,"Fort Campbell, Kentucky",USA,36.656453,-87.543622,beaten,"Pvt Winchell was beaten to death with a baseball bat while he slept by by Justin Fisher and Calvin N. Glover.

Barry was not trans himself, but was dating Calpernia Addams (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calpernia_Addams), who is  a transgender woman.

> In 1999, while working as a performer, Addams began dating PFC Barry Winchell. Word of the relationship spread at Winchell's Army base where he was harassed by fellow soldiers and ultimately murdered. Winchell's murder and the subsequent trial resulted in widespread press and a formal review of the U.S. ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" (DADT) military policy, ordered by President Bill Clinton.
> 
> The case became a prominent example used to illustrate the failure of DADT to protect LGBT service members. Addams' and Winchell's romance and the crimes of their abusers are depicted in the film Soldier's Girl, released in 2003. A subsequent New York Times article, ""An Inconvenient Woman"", documented the marginalization and misrepresentation of transgender sexuality even by gay rights activists.

Both Fisher and Glover were convicted of Barry Winchell's murder. The movie ""Soldier's Girl"" tells Barry and Calpernia's story.
