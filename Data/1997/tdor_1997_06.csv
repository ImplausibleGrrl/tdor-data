Kevin Freeman,,,,20-Jun-1997,tdor.info/6-20-1997/Kevin Freeman,"New York, New York",USA,40.713054,-74.007228,beaten,"Kevin's skull was split nearly in half.

> NEW YORK â€” Dion Webster talked loud and laughed louder. He was a prankster, a kid who got things started. But late one cold November night, his laughter ceased. He was found dead on the street, a knife shoved into his head.
> 
> Kevin Freeman was a quiet young man, an introvert with bright eyes. Six months after his friend Webster was murdered, Freeman's body turned up in a park not far away with his skull split.
> 
> Few mourned these two young men: their fellow street people, some social workers.
> 
> These were people passersby ignored, the type police rousted and arrested. They were homeless, addicted to crack cocaine and stuck in a dead end of life before age 30. Besides, they lived in the hidden realm of the ""transgendered,"" men believing they should have been born female. They worked the streets.
> 
> In a city that boasts its dropping crime rate and safer streets, their murders barely registered. There were no news conferences, no task forces, no public outcry.
> 
> ""They were dead already to the world. When they were killed, it just made it official,"" said Carl Siciliano, a social worker who knew them.
