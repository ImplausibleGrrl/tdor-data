According to police she had just been dropped off by a car near Hunting Park when the men surrounded her and beat her. When she fell to the ground, one of the attackers pulled out a gun and shot her in the back twice. She died in hospital.

Pedro Redding, 22, of Hunting Park, was subsequently arrested for robbery and murder.  Redding reportedly admits to beating her but insists that someone else fired the gun.

> Keisha was a Philadelphia native who previously attended West Philadelphia High School and was attending Temple University at the time of her death.
> 
> Friends and family described her as warm, jolly and “comfortable” in her own skin. She’s remembered for lovingly caring for her grandmother during her battle with cancer, by keeping grandma’s fridge stocked and being there for her during her “weakest moments.” Kiesha’s family can’t understand why anyone would want to kill her.

Keisha's Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009041886277.

She had been stabbed 13 times.

Her killing sparked an outcry from the country’s trans community – who face an extremely high murder rate.

> Sacayán was well respected in her home country for her work with LGBT rights group Movimento Antidiscriminatorio de Liberación and role as an alternate representative of the Trans Secretariat on the Board of ILGA (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association).
> 
> In 2012 she was one of the first transgender citizens to change their legal gender and was issued legal papers directly by Argentina’s president Cristina Kirchner.

In June 2018 her killer, Gabriel David Marino, 25, was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Buenos Aires criminal court. Marino was the first person in the country to be found guilty under a law that targets gender and hate violence against transgender people.
