Daya Rani,56,2015_07_03_Daya-Rani.jpg,https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/india-transgender-politician-who-ran-for-president-shot-dead,3-Jul-2015,tgeu/3 Jul 2015/Daya Rani Kinnar,"Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh",India,28.671153,77.412036,shot,"Daya was found dead in her room on the morning of 4th July. She had been shot through a window. The killer fired as a train passed so as not to be heard.

Two days later the police arrested two people at a bus stop in Ghaziabad.

> Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday claimed to have solved the murder case of transgender Daya Rani Kinnar with the arrest of two accused.
> 
> After investigation, Waris and Nadim were arrested from old Ghaziabad bus stand around 5.30 pm, Circle officer City 1st, Anil Kumar Yadav said, adding that their accomplice Sameer is still at large.
> 
> A country-made pistol, which was allegedly used to shoot her, and a knife have been recovered from their possession, he said.
> 
> During interrogation, the duo confessed that they murdered Daya Rani to usurp her wealth.
> 
> Also, Waris held a grudge against Daya after he got married to her niece Geeta, much against her (Daya's) wish. Later, Daya she let Geeta and her child stay at her house but did not allow Waris, he said.

Daya had always lived in Dasna, Ghaziabad. She lived with other trans women in a shared bungalow. 

> Although illiterate, in 2004, 2009 and 2014 Daya Rani contested the Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency in the General Election as an independent. In 2007 she ran for the Uttar Pradesh assembly. She stressed her gender identity: 
> 
> ""Why are people with me? Because other politicians fill their homes and cupboards. And I have no children, husband, wife or heirs. Whatever family I have is these people and I live off these people and I will fight for these people with the politicians who have not delivered on their promises.""
However in 2014 the District Magistrate cancelled her nomination. 

> Most of the news articles refer to Daya Rani as ""Daya Rani Kinnar"". However 'kinnar' is a local word for 'hijra'. Thus it is like referring to ""Sylvia Rivera Transgender"". Not a good practice. Not at all!

She died as a result of blunt force trauma.

The following evening hundreds of people attended a vigil at the park where her body was found.

A week after her murder Keith Lamayne Gaillard, 18, turned himself in and was booked on charges of first-degree murder and possession of a firearm.

> In keeping with a pattern that followed many of the previous nine murders of trans women this year, coverage of the investigation by local media often misgendered Clarke—identifying her with male pronouns or her birth name rather than her chosen name—despite established journalistic guidelines dictating that the media use an individual's preferred name and pronouns.
> 
> This refusal to acknowledge a name change is unique to transgender people. Journalists comply when rappers change their names, ""which they do frequently,"" says Andrew Seaman, ethics chair for the Society of Professional Journalists. It shouldn't be any different, he argues, for people who identify with a gender and a name different from those they were assigned at birth. So why do some journalists insist on misgendering India Clarke and other transgender people in the news?
> 
> In Clarke's case, the misgendering began with the police investigation. Despite the fact that Clarke clearly identified as female on her Facebook page, investigators have insisted on identifying the victim as male. ""We are not going to categorize him as a transgender. We can just tell you he had women's clothing on at the time,"" Detective Larry McKinnon, a spokesman for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office told BuzzFeed News. ""What his lifestyle was prior to that we don't know—whether he was a cross-dresser, we don't know."" (The only explanation as to why officials can't refer to Clarke as a woman appears to be the fact that the medical examiner identified her as a male.)
> 
> DESPITE THE FACT THAT CLARKE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS FEMALE ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE, INVESTIGATORS HAVE INSISTED ON IDENTIFYING THE VICTIM AS MALE.
> ""The police were basically saying, 'It's a man in a dress,'"" Seaman says. ""And what often happens—too often actually—is that journalists just take police reports and descriptions and run with it.""
> 
> While most journalists may be in favor of a policy in which any and all story subjects are referred to by their preferred pronouns–she, her, he, him, etc.–and updated style guides reflect that, another part of the problem may be that bad habits can be hard to shake. Advances in technology and medicine are often slow to catch on, and the same goes for journalism, according to Seaman. ""When there's a change in practice it takes time,"" he says. ""You can see the same thing with the terms 'undocumented' and 'illegal' immigrants. There are still places that use the term illegal immigrant when much of the profession has moved to undocumented immigrant.""
> 
> But it's more than just a ""whoopsie"" for the people who are misgendered. It undermines transgender acceptance and dignity, and in cases like Clarke's, it could impede justice. ""LGBT anti-violence organizations have long warned that misgendering transgender victims and quickly downplaying gender identity as a factor in investigations can alienate people who know the victims and who could provide tips that identify a suspect,"" BuzzFeed's Dominic Holden writes.
> 
> ""You're not doing anyone any favors by misgendering someone,"" Seaman adds. ""If you could avoid the harm caused to the victim, and in this case, the victim's family and friends who are the ones dealing with the aftermath of this, why wouldn't you?""

India was a cosmetology student. Her Facebook profile is https://www.facebook.com/india.milan.3.

> ""[She] was a good-hearted person. Very loving person,"" [her] mother, Thelma Clarke, told WTSP through tears.
> 
> Thelma says her [daughter] was different, but loved to laugh, make people smile, and certainly did not deserve to die the way [she] did.
> 
> ""[Her] last words when [she] headed out the door were, ""Mom, I love you, Dad, I love you. And we both said, 'We love you too.""

Haggard,"Fresno, California",USA,36.731654,-119.785856,throat cut,"Casey's throat was slashed after she was called over to a vehicle at around 2am on Thursday 23rd July. Afterwards she tried to flag down passing vehicles for help, but nobody stopped.

> Justice is finally being served for the horrific throat-slashing murder of transgender woman Casey Haggard. Originally Fresno police felt the murder caught on video was a random act of violence. But thanks to a local advocate’s persistence 38-year-old Richard Lopez has been charged with the slaying as a hate crime.
> 
> “This was a premeditated hate crime says KarenAdell Scot”, founder of TransCare. Scot told KMPF July 2015, “It was premeditated, and it was thought out. They had the knife ready. They baited the person to the vehicle and they followed through with tremendous precision on the strike.

In February 2018 police arrested Richard Joseph Lopez, 37, for her murder.
