Her body was found naked from the waist down floating in his pond on 17th April.

> Cleveland, January 2013 and 20-year-old Cemia “Ce Ce” Dove went out in the morning and was never seen alive again.
> 
> The same day two men called on local man Andrew Bridges looking for rent he owed. They noticed there was blood splattered in the house, a bonfire burning in the back yard and his hand was bleeding badly.
> 
> However, it was three months before police found Dove’s body in Bridges’s pond. She’d been stabbed 40 times and her body weighted with a lump of concrete.
> 
> 36-year-old Bridges had called Dove in the morning of the murder and paid $100 for a cab to bring her up to his house.
> 
> Exactly what happened is unknown but detectives think that when Bridges found out that Dove was [a trans woman], he became very angry and killed her.

Bridges was found guilty in November of the same year and sentenced to life in prison.

> “Justice was done,” said the victim’s mother, Martha Acoff. “My [daughter] is with me in spirit. Andrey Bridges is going to get what he deserves. He’s going to have to ask God for His forgiveness. I forgive him.”
