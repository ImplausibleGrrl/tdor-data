David F. McLaughlin,,,,1-Oct-1986,tdor.info/10-1-1986/David F. McLaughlin,"Syracuse, New York",USA,43.047945,-76.147448,beaten and stabbed,"David was beaten then stabbed twice in the neck and once in the back by Ronald J. Patnode. They were described in court as a  “transvestite hooker"" , but in reality was probably a transgender woman - and sadly we don't even know their social name.

Patnode was convicted but sentenced to only “two to six years” in prison on second-degree manslaughter (not murder) charges.

> It is almost as if a ""mere killing 11 is not enough We need to be obliterated, destroyed families of the victims often participate in this as well. Take the death of David McLaughlin, a “transvestite hooker"" who was stabbed to death in Syracuse, New York in October of 1986. In arguing the case against Roland Patnode, McLaughlin's killer, attorney James Meggesto said, ""the victim's lifestyle brought this confrontation to the forefront."" Patnode was acquitted of murder, and found guilty of the lesser crime of second-degree manslaughter.
