Note that Karla's name has been alternately spelled Carla by police reports documenting her death. Her Facebook profiles however use the former spelling.

Karla was only 18 years old, and just beginning her life. Blogger Monica Roberts shared this:

> Karla is the 9th person we have lost to anti-trans violence this year in the US. She's the seventh trans person of color and the second trans Latina we have lost in the US in 2018.
> 
> She also the first trans person in Texas we have lost this year. This murder also is infuriating me not only because it happened in my home state, but because she was just 18 years old.
> 
> She was just beginning to embark on her life journey, and who knows what Karla could have accomplished had she been allowed to simply live her life.

Several days earlier Karla Patricia Flores-Pavo had been found strangled in her North Dallas apartment. Castro said they did not believe the two cases were related.

She was being held at the privately run Cibola Correctional Facility in Milan, New Mexico. It has been repeatedly reported that asylum seekers at the border are held in freezing holding cells (often referred to as ""hieleras"") for days. Cibola is a facility for male inmates, which also suggests abusive behaviour by the authorities.

> ""Paired with the abuse we know transgender people regularly suffer in ICE detention, the death of Ms. Hernández sends the message that transgender people are disposable and do not deserve dignity, safety, or even life,"" said Isa Noyola, Deputy Director at Transgender Law Center.
> 
> ""It is alarming that transgender communities continue to face transphobic violence outside and inside of detention walls,"" says Flor Bermudez, Legal Director at Transgender Law Center. ""This is why TLC's Trans Immigrant Defense Effort (TIDE) has organized to demand the liberation of transgender women from detention and the end of all detention and deportations. ICE has shown time and again it is incapable of protecting transgender women in detention. Transgender people should not be detained by ICE, at all.""
> 
> ""We have been demanding the release of our trans communities detained in ICE detention centers because of rampant physical and brutal treatment from guards and other detainees,"" said Jorge Gutiérrez, Executive Director of Familia: Trans Queer Liberation Movement.
> 
> ""At a time when we are grieving the murders of transgender women of color, and the murder of 20 year-old Claudia Patricia Gómez Gonzalez by Border Patrol at the Texas-Mexico border, it is unconscionable that a transgender woman would die in the hands of ICE at the Cibola trans pod in immigration detention. The community, now more than ever, needs to organize to protect our most vulnerable, in particular transgender immigrant women who are surrounded by violence on a daily basis,"" added Anandrea Molina, President of Organización Latina de Trans en Texas.
> 
> Transgender immigrants often seek asylum, withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture because of violence, rape and torture they have experienced in their countries of origin due to their gender identity or expression. However, once inside the United States, transgender immigrants may often face similar risks, as well as criminalization, as they are targeted and harassed by police or held in detention where they experience violence, discrimination, and an inability to access to medical care, all of which may lead to dire consequences.

> ""We heard a lot of screams. The killers were very angry. They used brutality and violence to kill them. There were a lot of shots"" said one witness, who did not want to be identified.

Author note: This is one of those cases where the victim's identity isn't obvious. The only published photos may be current, or may be of their deadself. Their first name could be a deadname, or it could be one they used regularly. We have no way of knowing.

This is why their first name has been abbreviated and gender neutral pronouns are being used - quite honestly it's the safest thing to do in cases like this. More information may come to light to clarify things, or it may not.

Many in Portland's LGBTQ community still knew her by her male-assigned name and pronouns and did not know she was trans, according to friend Dawn Higgins-Wither.

Local news station KATU spoke to a witness they called Amber:

> ""I heard Gigi say, 'Don't touch me,'"" Amber told KATU. ""And the woman came up and hit Gigi in the face with her purse. That kinda set Gigi off.

Marty Dragonova,20,,,30/May/2018,,"Cardiff, Wales",United Kingdom,51.53939,-3.26165,suicide,"Marty died by overdosing on caffeine drinks and tablets. A coroner said it was clear that he intended to take his own life.

He was pronounced dead at 2am on Wednesday 30th May.

Marty was originally from Sofia in Bulgaria and had been studying English and French literature at Cardiff University. He had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria by a GP in 2017 and referred to an NHS gender identity clinic.

It is not known whether NHS waiting lists, treatment delays or the way he was treated by clinicians contributed to his suicide, but sadly this has to be a distinct possibility - two months earlier Jacob Whelan had died by suicide in the same city after struggling with long NHS treatment delays.

[See https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/reports/2018/03/17/jacob-whelan_cardiff-wales-united-kingdom_3097f77d]

> In a written statement provided to the court, Marty's father Marian Dragonova described Marty as having an ""interest in languages, particularly English and French"" and said Marty had wanted to study in the UK for years.
> 
> Assistant Coroner Graeme Hughes said it was clear that Marty intended to take their own life.
> 
> He said: ""On the 29th of May, [he] had consumed an extremely high amount of caffeine with the intention to take [his] own life.
> 
> ""[He] was discovered by [his] flatmate and [he] was taken to hospital but died shortly after. My conclusion is that how Marty came about [his] death is one of suicide.""
