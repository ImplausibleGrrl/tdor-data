Five months before her death, she had been picked up by an off-duty vice officer, who fired his service pistol twice during an argument over money. The officer quit during an internal investigation. Another officer was fired, and two other officers were suspended.

Scott was killed five days before she was to be a witness in a hearing about one of the suspensions. Very little has been done since them to apprehend her murderer.
