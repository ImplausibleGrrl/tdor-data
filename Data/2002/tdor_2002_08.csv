Stephanie Thomas,19,2002_08_12_Stephanie-Thomas_Ukea-Davis.jpg,https://transgriot.blogspot.com/2011/08/9th-anniversary-of-stephanie-and-ukeas.html,12-Aug-2002,tdor.info/8-12-2002/Stephanie Thomas,"Washington, D.C.",USA,38.892062,-77.019912,shot,"Stephanie Thomas and her best friend Ukea Davis (who was also transgender) were both shot dead in the same car.

Stephanie and Ukea were best friends who did everything together. They met at a local Washington organisation for GLBT teens called SMYAL, transitioned together, shared an apartment - and died together in a hail of bullets on 12th August 2002.

> Around 11:30 p.m. the night of the 11th, 19-year-old Thomas and her best pal, 18-year-old Ukea Davis, reportedly told friends they were going to a nearby gas station for cigarettes. Nobody can say for sure where they actually went.
> 
> But just about everybody in the city knows that a little after 3 a.m., the friends were sitting in Thomas' Camry at a stop sign on the corner of 50th and C. Almost home. Then a car came up beside them, and the two were pelted with fire from a semiautomatic weapon.
> 
> According to an eyewitness report, another car approached after the shooting. A man got out to see what had happened. Davis was already dead. When the man nudged Thomas' shoulder to see if she was still alive, she moaned in confirmation. But her helper fled as the first car returned. The gunman got out and fired more shots, making sure Thomas was dead.
> 
> By the time rescue workers reached the bloody car, she was. Like her friend's, Thomas' body had been pumped full of bullets — at least 10 apiece.

The location they died was the same Washington DC street corner where a few years earlier trans woman Tyra Hunter [1] had the fatal car accident that led to her death.
