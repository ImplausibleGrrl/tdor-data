He died in hospital.

> Police in Arizona knew they’d be dealing with someone who may not be in the right frame of mind when they arrived at the home of 24-year-old Kayden Clarke. Friends had called police fearing for Clarke, a transgender man, was suicidal. When police arrived Clarke allegedly charged at two officers with a knife and at least one of them opened fire, reports the Arizona Republic.  
> 
> Clarke suffered from Asperger syndrome, a form of autism in which otherwise intelligent people may lack social skills and suffer from a range of atypical behavior. According to videos on YouTube and posts on Facebook from friends that have since been deleted or marked private, Clarke also allegedly suffered a history of physical and sexual abuse as a child that left him with post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation.

In December, Clarke had posted a video in which he announced that his insurance would pay for his reassignment surgery. ""I'm so happy,"" he said.

She died in hospital shortly after midnight.

Tiffany E. Floyd, 25, and Jose Pena, 19, were arrested for her murder. Floyd was sentenced to 8-20 years in jail plus 10 years of probation for third-degree murder. Pena was sentanced to 40-80 years for the first-degree murder of Maya and the unrelated murder of Jonathan Martel. Both had stabbed Maya, but it was the second stabbing by Pena which ultimately killed her.

> Maya Young had a distinctive birthmark: One side of her face was light and the other dark, with a line down the middle separating the brown tones.
> 
> ""She looked like chocolate and caramel,"" said Anthony Harper, a longtime friend and former roommate of the 25-year-old transgender woman. He used to call her ""Twix,"" like the candy bar. ""She was sweet, like candy. She loved people and she loved being around people,"" he said.

After the pair were sentenced Maya's sister said:

> “It’s finally over. It can never bring her back or take away the pain but, at the end of the day, I feel like she can rest better now that justice was served in her favor”.

Maya was the third known transgender woman of color killed in Philadelphia over the course of a year, after Kiesha Jenkins 22, in October 2015, and London Kiki Chanel in May 2015.

He died at the scene.

Matthews turned himself in to local police on the day of the shooting and confessed to the killing.

Matthews originally told the police that he shot Stansberry by accident under the belief that his gun was empty after removing the clip on New Year’s Eve. However, local reports claim that Stansberry was shot at point-blank range with the shooter standing at his side.

He was charged with negligent homicide, illegal use of a weapon, and possession of a firearm by a felon.

> “We are saddened by the loss of Demarkis Stansberry, and send our condolences to his loved ones,” said Emily Waters of the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs in a statement. “We are only beginning to see national visibility around the disproportionate violence that transgender people face in this nation. Violence against transgender men has been largely missing from these conversations, and we must encourage a discussion of the unique ways that transgender men experience violence.”
> 
> Elizabeth Anne Jenkins, president of Louisiana Trans Advocates, on her Facebook page said that Stansberry was a member of her organisation.
