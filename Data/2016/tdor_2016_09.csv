Moreno went to trial for transfeminicide in May 2019. He was convicted and sentenced to life the following month.
 
> In the courtroom on the second floor of the Courthouse this day will begin the oral debate for the murder of a trans woman, which occurred on the morning of Saturday, September 10, 2016 in a house in the city of Palpalá and the fact that his partner arrives accused of being the alleged author.
> 
> Zoe Nazarena Quispe (36) was killed by 36 stabbings in different parts of her body, after a violent discussion with Jesús Pantaleón Moreno (26), after having returned from a dance bowl and entering the house they shared, located on the Avenida Libertad 100 in the San Martín neighborhood of the steel city, between 4 and 7 that morning.

> At the trial, in which several trans people who were friends or knew the victim testified, it was stated that Zoe was a victim of violence by Moreno, with whom she had been for two years.
>
> Patricia Garcia, Zoe's sister-in-law who testified at the second hearing, told Presentes that the defendant ""was aggressive, beat her."" Zoe's father, mother and sisters, especially the older one, Marta Mamaní, saw these assaults.
>
> Father, mother and sister have already declared and related the acts of violence of which they testified. Instead, Patricia said she never knew of these attacks, but recalled that ""sometimes"" saw ""bruises on the arms"" of Zoe. However, ""I never asked who did this to you?  or did you hit? , nothing; It was an error of not asking, ""she lamented.
> 
> Zoe was a sex worker (like 90 percent of trans people, excluded early from education and work), and lived with her partner in their parents' house. In the trial some it was reported that Moreno was upset when Zoe received messages regarding her work, but then accepted the money that she had earned.
> 
> Her sister-in-law, Patricia, said that she witnessed scenes of jealousy by Moreno, ""he hid his cell phone, he took out his cell phone,"" he said. ""(The accused) was a very jealous person, he knew how to watch over Zoe with my son, that is, with his own nephew,"" the sister-in-law recalled. The first three children of García and Oscar Quispe, Zoe's brother, were very attached to their aunt: ""They loved her a lot"" and every time they went to visit the family, they spent hours talking with Zoe in her room. ""But she once raised the issue that Lucas did not want my son to go up to the room because he was jealous of what could happen between them, that is, already a sick guy.""
>
> The technical reports did not stop Moreno either. One of those reports confirms that he has a cellopathic personality and that this motivated arguments and aggressions against his partner.

> Dealing with murders is not for anyone. But there is a big difference between seeing a dead person and a dying person. 
> 
> And that's what happened in front of a dozen people around 8:00 p.m. on Thursday (15), in General Jardim street, central region of São Paulo, witnessing a trans woman shot on the sidewalk with a bullet mark on the abdomen, from which flowed a thread of blood that flowed into the ditch.
> 
> Shots were heard. Two blocks away, a car and a few police officers were standing. But the sound did not get there. Around the body, about five people. One young man reported that he saw the victim being thrown out of a gray, gray Fox model car. In fright, he ran, along with a lady. On her return, Larissa lay alternating the movement of her breast between weak sighs and others that were like trying to get back to life.
> 
> When her chest did not move for a long time, the people next to her chanted her name and pleaded, ""Larissa, breathe."" And she responded with a deep sigh, but clearly the result of a massive effort.
> 
> Police. Firemen. Curious. Larissa.
> 
> A friend asked to pick up her phone and, according to her, to call her mother. The officer denies the request. The victim needs to breathe.
> 
> The area is secluded. Rescuers insist on cardiac massage and begin to apply some medicine in the region of the shot. Larissa's belly becomes swollen and continues to move in a superhuman movement, because of the pressure on the rib cage.
> 
> She will be rescued. A relief, for now. She's alive.
> 
> The girl was taken to the Hospital das Clínicas. To R7 , the hospital's press office reports that Larissa died at dawn on Friday (16). She succumbed to the violence to which her body was exposed. In the streets, as a trans woman, the victim was exposed daily to all kinds of violence, which only those who live in and on the streets know.
> 
> Larissa was the social name of a young trans woman who was born in Passos (MG). At 31 years of age and only a full first degree, the trans woman circulated through the downtown streets and made her hair in a salon in the area. There, a block from where she died.
> 
> Finding the culprit will not be easy. No one say the car numberplate. One resident of the fateful street commented that most of the security cameras in the area where Larissa was shot do not work.
> 
> The victim who was ""nothing,"" became a statistic in a country that reeks of violence against transgender women while pornographic videos with this category are preferred among Brazilians. Something of a questionable logic.

She had been shot in the back of the head.

She was taken to hospital but died a few hours later.

> To her family, Crystal was known by a few names. Because, as a child, she had a bump on her face, they called her Bumpkis, Bumpy, and then Bumpers. But mostly they called her Ms. Crystal. Now and then the family referred to her by her birth name, or as many in the trans community call it, her dead name. Deadnaming is the act of referring to a trans person by their birth name instead of their chosen name. Some of the family members also had an issue using Crystal's preferred pronouns. However, they spoke highly and honestly of her. You could see how fresh this trauma was on all of the family's faces. Any time Crystal's sister spoke of her, she would fight back tears.
> 
> ""Crystal was an incredible cook, but her specialty was baking,"" Ms. Vanessa said, grinning from ear to ear. ""She loved to bake. When holidays came she baked everything. I don't even want to think about the holidays this year. It's gonna be hard.""

Jazz Alford,30,2016_09_28_Jazz-Alford.jpg,https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/10/08/black-transgender-woman-shot-and-killed-in-alabama-hotel-room/,28-Sep-2016,,"Birmingham, Alabama",USA,33.5115934,-86.8180927,shot,"Jazz was shot dead in a room at the Kings Inn hotel. Her body was discovered by housekeeping staff.

Denzell Thomas, 22, was indicted for her murder after being arrested for shooting another trans woman during a home invasion and robbery.

> Alford’s sister Toya Milan, who is also transgender, described her sibling as a “loving person”. The family said they “didn’t know anybody that would want to hurt her.”
> 
> “Her death was a huge hit for the LGBT community. There was another transgender person shot multiple times somewhere else recently. People think transgender people are monsters, when really we just want to be accepted,” said Milan.
> 
> The homicide division at Birmingham Police Department reportedly were aware of Alford’s trans identity, but didn’t reveal it because of “case security.” This led to media outlets wrongly misgendering her.
> 
> Jazz worked as a reservation agent at U.S. Airways, according to a friend who spoke to Mic. She traveled frequently and loved to visit Philadelphia and Atlanta. According to her brother, she was very spiritual and loved to sing. 

Jazz's murder was not recorded on the official TDoR 2016 list released by Transgender Europe (TGEU).

She died almost instantly.

> ""This guy arrived and it looked like he was drugged and drunk, and my friend got up to give him the service, but the car did not go seven meters when he shot her twice and killed her.""
> 
> ""I began to scream desperately, and in that instant a patrol passed and stopped him while he was still inside the car,"" he said.

Her companions tried to come to her aid and managed to stop the car with the help of the crew of a police patrol. Although her killer was arrested, 48 hours later he was released on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to link him to the homicide process.

Paola's body was delivered to her friends on Sunday, before taking her to a funeral home.

> A couple of hours later the remains of Paola arrived at the wake, there she spent the night between prayers and tears of her acquaintances. Her funeral was a luxury, the cost exceeded 25 thousand pesos for the ward, the coffee service, advice on paperwork, transfer, embalming, makeup and burial in the Civil Pantheon of San Lorenzo Tezonco in Iztapalapa.
> 
> ""In order to pay for the funeral, girls from different areas cooperated: de la Merced, Sullivan, Insurgentes, Puente de Alvarado and even Tlalpan. You see a few here but there are many who supported with something, they can be whores ... but not culeras"", explained Adriana Barrios Ruiz who had rented to Paola for more than a year a small room where she lived in the street of Doctor Enrique González Martínez and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz in the Doctores colony.
