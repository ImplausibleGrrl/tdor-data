She was well known and active in the drag and pageant communities in Haines City.

> Several local media reports on Successful’s death misgendered the victim, identifying her with male pronouns and a masculine name. A follow-up report published Tuesday by Lakeland newspaper The Ledger includes quotes from Successful’s friends confirming that she had recently begun a clinical transition to live full-time as her authentic self, but the article wholly avoids pronouns and uses the late performer’s given name to identify her throughout. In addition to needlessly noting that Successful was “not dressed like a woman when found,” the Ledger article indicates that police are not currently investigating the murder as a hate crime.

She was ignored by doctors and refused access to either the male or female wards following complaints from staff and patients. She died of her injuries on Wednesday morning.

Alisha was the Peshawar coordinator and one of eight board members of Trans Action Alliance, an advocacy group that has been increasingly vocal in seeking equal rights for transgender people in the province.

In Facebook posts, Trans Action said the gang that shot Alesha specifically targets members of the transgender community, and sometimes sexually assaults them while recording the crime.

> For an hour, while Alesha bled, doctors couldn't decide whether to admit her to the men's or women's ward, according to Trans Action. When they finally decided on the men's ward, Trans Action protested, and had her moved to the women's ward, where other women apparently complained.
> 
> Then the taunts began, Trans Action said. One doctor allegedly asked a Trans Action volunteer for her telephone number and how much she charges for a dancing party. Another was reportedly asked if her breasts were real. Another asked if the women from Trans Action just danced or also ""perform sex,"" according to the group.
