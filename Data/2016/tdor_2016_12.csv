> Andrea was a trans woman, she was 20 years old, she lived with her family in a humble neighborhood of Ciudad del Este and suffered from a disability that prevented her from listening and speaking. She survived by sex work on San Blas Avenue, along with other trans women who, like her, are excluded from the labor market. That night there were other compañeras nearby, and thanks to their testimony, the crime scene was reconstructed.
> 
> That night in December, around 10:30 p.m., a man in a white vehicle approached her. He lowered the window of the car and, without saying a word, began to shoot at her. She received eight bullet wounds and fell dead on the spot.
> 
> “They kill us because we are trans women, they kill us out of hatred, they kill us because they do not forgive us for having disobeyed their guidelines and their roles, they kill us because they know they are in a country that does not have the tools to protect us”

Several days after the murder a client, Narciso Melgarejo, was arrested and charged with intentional homicide.

According to the Istanbul LGBTI Association, she was a transgender woman who lost her family in the Syrian war and was working in a bar near Taksim Square.

Istanbul LGBTI activist Kivilcim Arat who met with her four days before her murder stated to KaosGL.org that:

> “We interviewed with about fifteen Syrian refugee sex worker, transgender women. Sendi was one of these women. All refugee transgender women complain of two things: intense police and 'community' violence. No documents are given to the refugees because of a recent problem in the system. The system is down. Having a legal status is the basic demand of transgender women. Actually, we met with Sendi because of this issue. We planned to give legal advice to her.”

Note that some of the news reports name Sendi as ""Werde"".

Her death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.

Both had been stabbed and Gabriela had also been strangled.

Both were killed by Samuele Turco - Gabriela's ex-boyfriend. After killing Kelly, he then lured Gabriela to her death by sending her a text message from Kelly's phone.

> Once again. Already there was a glimpse of some press indiscretion: Gabriela had left a man and he was persecuting her with phone calls, messages, chases. Gabriela had asked for help: she wanted to be left alone. Kelly was her friend. Gabriela was looking for support and defense: Kelly was willing to give her all this.
> 
> Two sides of a coin: life and affection on the one hand, and horror and death on the other.
> 
> Kelly was a very popular figure in Parmaand province. Originally from Langhirano, she had been the promoter of events and shows in several clubs of the city. Alongside her red light activity, she had animated the night life of the Emilian capital, especially during the 90s, when she promoted some of the trendiest and most loved clubs by young people, not only of the gay community. So today many people wanted to remember ""the Kelly"" posting a message on social media and remembering one of her irreverent jokes or even one of her many shows that, writes a friend, ""had shaken from the torpor this city still too provincial"".

Kelly's death was not included on the official TGEU TDoR 2017 list.

An inquest into her death ruled that she died by misadventure.

> Clarke told jurors she was aware that Swift had previously tried to kill herself and that she was on suicide watch, formally known as assessment care in custody teamwork (ACCT). Swift’s ACCT plan said she had to be checked on by a prison officer every 30 minutes.
> 
> Jurors were told that Swift had been taking hormone replacement treatment (HRT) drugs she had bought over the internet before she arrived at HMP Doncaster in November, five weeks before she killed herself.
> 
> Barney Branston, the barrister for Serco, which runs HMP Doncaster, suggested to Clarke that the bullying they alleged was simply a staff member being “robust”. Clarke replied: “I get that but I still saw the way she [the prison officer] was as bullying. In my view she wasn’t very professional.”
> 
> Friends and two fellow inmates told the inquest Swift struggled without the medication and was desperate to be moved to a female prison. Clarke said Swift was very upset at no longer being on HRT drugs and had told her days before her death: “I’m starting to turn back into a man.”
