Mikey Vallejo-Seiber,3,12-Aug-2002,2005_08_29_Mikey-Vallejo-Seiber.jpg,https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59088475/micheal-a.-vallejo-seiber,29-Aug-2005,tdor.info/29-Aug-2005/Mikey Vallejo-Seiber,Riverside,California,USA,33.980534,-117.377025,beaten,"Mikey was beaten to death by his father, Alex Mendoza, who had repeatedly called him a ""sissy”.

Mendoza also often slapped his son in an effort to ""toughen him up,” and urged him to beat up an Elmo doll. Mikey Vallejo-Seiber died in a local hospital from internal injuries sustained from being kicked, punched, and dropped on his head while in Mendoza’s care.

Mikey's mother Pamela Seiber pleaded guilty to child endangerment and - two days after what would have been Mikey's fourth birthday - was sentenced to 6yrs in prison for failing to protect her son.

Mendoza entered a plea of not guilty and was sentenced to 25 years to life.

Editors note: Although we will obviously never know whether Mikey may eventually have identified as trans, it is fitting that he be remembered here.
