Sanchez,Belize City,Belize,17.4934056,-88.2095261,stabbed,"J. was found dead on Elston Kerr Street in the early hours of Sunday 12th January. She had been stabbed.

She had been was on her way to a party dressed in a white sleeveless vest and a short green and black skirtt, when she was attacked by two men who stabbed her to death. Belizean LGBT NGO UNIBAM called the murder a hate crime. It was reported that she had been harassed and received death threats before in the days leading to her murder.

> Police have evidence which says that Sanchez - dressed in full drag - was seen walking up and down on Elston Kerr Street near the Lord's Ridge Cemetery after 1:00 am. The evidence says that two men on bicycles rode up and are tried to rob Sanchez. [She] put up a fight, and in the scuffle one of them stabbed [her] in the chest. Sanchez ran and collapsed a short distance away.

Media reports variously describe J. as a gay man who crossdressed and a ""teenager who identified with a transgender orientation"". We'll probably never know their true gender identity, but female pronouns are used above for consistancy with their presentation at the time they died.
