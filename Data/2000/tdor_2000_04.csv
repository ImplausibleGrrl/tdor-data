> 
> Very little information about Tyra's homicide case is unknown as well as very liitle personal information except for the fact that she was living on the 1700 Block of T Street, S.E. in Washington D.C.
> 
> A complaint was filed against police by someone relating to Tyra's case, that police took too long to respond to a 911 call placed at 2:20 AM in relation to sounds of a person moaning in the alleyway where Henderson's body was found. The complainant sought help from the ACLU of the National Capitol Area for the allegation against police, which at the time of January 17, 2018 is still listed as being ""under review"" by police.
> 
> Prostitution could be involved with the crime, as in 2006 Gender Public Advocacy Coalition, also known as Gender PAC, revealed that Tyra was involved in sex work as a means for survival.
