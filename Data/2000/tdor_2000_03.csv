Her brother Charles Halfacree was jailed for four years and three months after admitting manslaughter and charges related to disposing of her body.

Halfacree had hidden her body in a shed for a month before buying chains and weights and floating it out to sea from Covehithe, Suffolk. It eventually washed up on a beach four miles away in Kessingland, Suffolk.

Five months later he and his accomplice Alison Hooley, 38, were arrested. Hooley was Christine's ex-wife.

Hooley admitted removing evidence of Ms Chappel's killing and lying to police. She was jailed for 19 months.

Christine was divorced and had a daughter. She was believed to have been born in Perth, Australia, and studied electronic engineering at Salford University before moving to Essex.

Neighbours said she had been depressed in the weeks leading up to her death.
