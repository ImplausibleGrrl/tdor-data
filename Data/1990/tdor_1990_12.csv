> But I read the list of dead above, and come to the second victim, after “Edna Brown” — “unknown person wearing wig”. And it hits me — there are still segments of our society it is easier to see in those terms. Not as someone’s (possibly estranged) son, who wished in his heart of hearts he’d been born a daughter, not as someone’s best friend. No, we forget the flashing brilliance of the Lady Chablis in that moment, and it’s just some unknown dead person who was found wearing a wig.

Lim Yeow Chuan,,,,,31-Dec-1990,tdor.info/1990/Lim Yeow Chuan,,,Singapore,1.290453,103.852038,stabbed,"Lim Yeow Chuan was stabbed multiple times by Kuppiah Saravanan. Her attacker was jailed.

> The appellant was charged with the murder of a male transvestite (“the victim”) by stabbing him to death. The appellant and his friend, Kuppiah, went in search of the victim after suspecting the victim of stealing a gold chain and money belonging to another friend. When they found and confronted the victim, the latter feigned ignorance and became abusive. Kuppiah threatened the victim with assault. On hearing this, the victim stepped back, drew out a knife andpointed it at Kuppiah and made as if to go at Kuppiah with the knife. At thisp oint, the appellant kicked the victim in the stomach and the victim fell and lost hold of the knife. The appellant did not go for the fallen knife until he noticed that the victim was reaching out for it. After the appellant picked up the knife,the victim rushed at the appellant, and the appellant stabbed the victim’s buttock. The victim grabbed the appellant’s upper arm, and the appellant stabbed the victim a second time to free himself, inflicting the first of two fatal wounds. The victim was unrelenting and charged at the appellant again, whereupon the second fatal wound was inflicted when the victim ran into theknife. At the end of the trial, the judge found the appellant guilty and convicted him under s300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap224, 1985Rev Ed). The appellant appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
