### What is this repository for? ###

This repository holds raw data on deaths of transgender people by violence, suicide etc. as presented by tdor.translivesmatter.info.

For each TDoR year, CSV files are provided for each month, and a folder of photos of victims where known.


### How do I get set up? ###

Just clone the repository. Inidividual CSV files can be edited with a spreadsheet such as Excel or LibreOffice Calc.

When you are finished making changes, submit a pull request. I recommend that each commit be atomic and related to a single entry or group of entries rather than a "mass commit" as the latter are much more complex to merge.


### Contribution guidelines ###

* When contributing data try to be factual and concise but not waffly (take a look at existing entries for examples).

* The first line of each "Description" field will go onto memorial cards so try not to make it too long or the text may not fit on the page.

* Try to include details which are relevant, and which give an impression of who the victim was.

* Include links to primary sources if you can, but remember to include trigger warnings if the page a link references is particularly gory.

Note that as the names of many victims and locations contain characters with accents etc., CSV files should always be saved with UTF-8 encoding or data will be lost.


### Who do I talk to? ###
